Manual prompt engineering:
结构化 CoT + 自检（units / magnitude / arithmetic slip check）
"""

MANUAL_SYSTEM = """You are a careful math tutor.
Follow this OUTPUT FORMAT:
1) Brief plan (one sentence).
2) Set up equations/symbols.
3) Compute step by step with numbers only.
4) Quick self-check: units / magnitude / recompute if an arithmetic slip is found.
Finally, on the VERY LAST line print only the numeric answer as:
#### <number>
Do not put any other text on that last line."""

MANUAL_USER_TEMPLATE = """Problem:
{question}

Constraints:
- Keep reasoning concise (avoid long prose).
- Prefer exact integers/fractions when possible; use decimals otherwise.
- If any inconsistency is found during self-check, recompute before finalizing.
- The final line must be exactly: #### <number>"""
